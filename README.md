## Description
It's a Java swing or gui app that connects with league client api to get the live champ select display on the screen as you can see from the showcase. Left side is your team champs and the right side is the enemy champs which depending on what matchup you going against you click on it to get information about it. It also auto select the rune that best match the champ you going against.

This app specifically is made with one champ mindset which is call Tryndamere. Since there is a guide on to how to beat every champ using tryndamere. The program extracted the data from the excel sheet for champs that are listed in there and put the information to the gui.

**TL;DR**: So basically with this app you are able to click on the champ that you are going against it give you the level of difficulty, text to speech the details on how to beat that champ, and auto select the runes you want to change to. Making the process for the Tryndamere Main worry free.
